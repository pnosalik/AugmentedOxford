	<string name="help_text">The left panel shows the tours of Oxford that you can choose from.\n
	    Use the dropdown menu on the top bar to change how the tours are sorted. This can be done in 3 ways:\n
	    - by filename (default)\n
	    - alphabetically\n
	    - by proximity to the start of the tour (needs a GPS signal)\n
	    Touch a tour to see its details in the right panel.\n
	    If you cannot see the complete list of locations on the tour, touch the list and scroll.\n
	    When you decide which tour you want, click the blue Start Tour button!
